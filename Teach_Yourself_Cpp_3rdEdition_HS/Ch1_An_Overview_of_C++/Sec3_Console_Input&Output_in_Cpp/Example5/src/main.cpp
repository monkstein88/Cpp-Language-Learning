/*
	Example 5.: By default, when you use the '>>' , all input is line buffered. This means that no information is passed to your C++ program
	untill you press ENTER. (In C, the 'scanf()' function is line buffered, so this style of input should not be new to you.) To see the
	effect of line-buffered input, try this program:

*/
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
	char ch;

	cout << "Enter keys, x to stop.\n";
	do{
		cout << ": " ;
		cin >> ch ;
	}while(ch != 'x');

	return 0;
}

/*
	When you test this program, you will have to press ENTER after each key you type in order of the correspondi character to be sent to
	the program.
*/
